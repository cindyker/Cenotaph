 Description

Cenotaph - A Dead Man's chest plugin for Bukkit
Save your players' inventory from disappearing when they die.

VERSION for Minecraft 1.14.4 and above only!
Forward support only!

Source: https://github.com/cindyker/Cenotaph

=============
 Features
=============
If the player is carrying a chest when they die, place that chest and fill it with as much of their inventory as possible.
If the player is allowed, and is carrying two chests, a large chest will spawn to catch all of their inventory.
Possible for specific groups/players to be given free chests with no need to carry one with them.
Any items that won't fit in the chest will still drop to the ground!
Supports the Permissions plugin, will default to allowing everyone to use basic tombstone if not available.
Configurable timeout for destruction of tombstones, works in unloaded chunks as well.
Configurable security for tombstones to protect from looters. Can have a timeout.
Quickloot support, right click the sign on a tombstone to loot all items in it (Your tombstone only!)
Place a sign on top of the chest stating the players name and time of death.
The ability to point your compass at your tombstones!
Configurable messages on Cenotaph signs.
Admin commands for management via console and in-game.
WorldGuard and Towny integration, to prevent players making cenotaphs where they cannot build.
Fully Translatable.

 Commands
=============
User commands:

      Lists your current cenotaphs with index numbers for the other commands.
  /cenfind <index>
     Gives more information about a specific cenotaph and sets your compass to point at it.
  /ceninfo <index>
      Description: Tells how much time is left before a specific cenotaph unlocks or breaks
  /cenreset
      Sets your compass to point to your spawn again after using /cenfind

Admin commands:
  /cenadmin list
      Displays all players with cenotaphs.
  /cenadmin list <player>
      Displays all cenotaphs for a player with indexes.
  /cenadmin find <player> <index>
      Displays additional information about a specific cenotaph (does not set compass like the user version does).
  /cenadmin info <player> <index>

  /cenadmin reload
      Reloads the config and language file settings.

=============
 Config
=============
See default config file for options and instructions. Config will update itself smartly as you update to newer Cenotaph versions, 
keeping the values you've set in earlier versions and adding new values at their default settings.

======================
 Custom Language Files
======================
In order to use a custom language file you must use a filename that Cenotaph does not already use for a language file.
If you want to make a custom language file do the following:
  1. Copy the supplied english.yml, 
  2. Rename it to customenglish.yml (or the custom language of your choice,)
  3. Set the language filename in the config.yml.
  4. Edit the new custom file to your liking.

If you do not rename your file, Cenotaph will overwrite it with the default english.yml.
If you do use a custom language file remember to check if it needs updating when you update your Cenotaph.
  
==================
 To Build yourself
==================
Convert to Maven Project and right click pom.xml > run as Maven Install.
All dependencies should be located at their respective repos.

 Credits
=============
Drakia: Cenotaph was originally Tombstone, by Drakia (TheDgtl). Many thanks to him for his hard work on the original plugin. You can access his Github repository here: https://github.com/TheDgtl/Tombstone
Southpaw018: Took over Tombstone from Drakia, renaming it to Cenotaph. Developed Cenotaph from v1.3.0 up to v3.1.
Acru: Thanks to Acru, the developer of Lockette, as well. His help getting the Lockette integration working as I stumbled by way though picking up Java was invaluable. :)
cindyker: I removed the hard dependency on lockette for being available. Deadbolt and Lockette use the same sign types. So now it will just use the config to decide. Lead developer from v4.0 up to v5.0.
LlmDl: I helped with lockette support on earlier versions and did some major changes on versions 5.1->Current.

=============
 Changes
=============
[Version 6.1]

  - Update support for Slimefun's Soulbound items.

  - Added english.yml.
  - Added ability to translate all messages.
  - New Config Option: core.pvp_kills_dont_get_chests
    - default: false
    - If set to true when players are killed by other players there is no cenotaph made.
  - Added missing death causes.
  - Added protection against hoppers and hoppercarts taking items from cenotaphs.
  - Fix causes of deaths on signs when an arrow or other projectile killed the player.
[Version 5.7]
  - Add support for Slimefun's Soulbound items - these are no longer placed into cenotaphs.
[Version 5.6]
  - Add CAVE_AIR & BUBBLE_COLUMN to replaceable materials list.
[Version 5.5]
  - Remove Wither Roses from the canReplace list.
[Version 5.4]
  - Added support for HolographicDisplays
    - When present, and enabled in the config, Cenotaph will spawn a hologram on top of the cenotaph rather than a sign.
  - Added command: /cenadmin deletehologram
    - Removes orphaned holograms from cenotaphs
    - Must be in same chunk and within 5 blocks distance of the hologram
    - Requires cenotaph.admin.deletehologram permission node.
[Version 5.3]
  - New database schema. Old databases will auto-convert.
  - Removed lockette and LWC support and replaced it with built-in security system that requires no signs.
  - Moved various things over to a new CenotaphUtil.
  - Moved listeners to their own package.
  - Cleaned up startup sequence.
  - Fixed double chests spawning as two separate single chests. (Showed up as a bug in MC 1.13)
  - Made signs on top of double chests always face the 'foot' of the tomb, enhancing the realism of the blocky tomb-like sign/chest combination.
  - Fixed dynmap support.
  - Added protection from pistons/explosions/burning to built-in security.
  - Replaced TNT/Creeper Protection with generalized explosions protection.
  - Changed from bukkit to spigot for development.
  - Added actionbar messages for Denial of access to secured/protected chests, this will lessen some of the chat spam.
  - Created CenotaphMessaging to handle messages.
  - Added the ability for /cenadmin to be used by the console.
  - Added a CenotaphMessaging function that can smartly send to player or console (if the sender is not a player.)
  - Fix up the findPlace function for finding good spots for chests.
    - No longer will dying with a full inventory in a 1x1x1 hole cause only one chest to be used while the rest overflows onto the ground.
    - When double chests are required the oneBlockUpCheck is always tried for (if enabled.)
  - Remove noReplaceList which wasn't actually doing anything that the OneBlockUpCheck does better.
  - Update list of blocks that can be replaced in the canReplace(mat) function.
    - Covers crops via Ageable, use tags for small flowers and saplings.
  - Remove the noDestroy option from the config, which became redundant after the security became built-in.
    - Set your config's security to not time-out and you have the exact same effect.
[Version 5.2]
  - Completely replaced the config with dumptruckman's CommentedConfiguration system.
    - This means you don't have to regenerate your config.yml after updating Cenotaph.
    - System is used by Towny/TownyChat and many other plugins.
    - New config options in the future will add themselves with default settings.
  - Removed the deathmessages section of the config.yml
    - For now entity names are pulled from the server, meaning new entities are automatically handled.
    - Environmental deathcauses are hardcoded to English for the time being.
  - Removed version checker option from config, I don't think this worked.
  - Cleaned up some of the TODO's that were done.
[Version 5.1]
  - Update to much of the Lockette/Sign code to make it not use deprecated API.
  - Update to use UUIDs in TombBlocks, allowing us to use less deprecated methods.
  - Update to pom.xml's sk89q's repos, making them not be required in the lib folder.
  - Update to economy handler, no longer errors when Vault is not found on a server.
  - Old databases will have old tombstones which do not have ownerUUID
    values. These will be null, and means that for those tombstones there
    will be no message sent to a player when their security runs out/they
    have their tombstone destroyed, (but these messages wouldn't be shown
    anyways if this happened while they were offline.)
