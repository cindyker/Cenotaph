Configurable security for tombstones to protect from looters. Can have a timeout.

 Credits
=============
Drakia: Cenotaph was originally Tombstone, by Drakia (TheDgtl). Many thanks to him for his hard work on the original plugin. You can access his Github repository here: https://github.com/TheDgtl/Tombstone
Acru: Thanks to Acru, the developer of Lockette, as well. His help getting the Lockette integration working as I stumbled by way though picking up Java was invaluable. :)
cindyker: I removed the hard dependency on lockette for being available. Deadbolt and Lockette use the same sign types. So now it will just use the config to decide.
LlmDl: I helped with lockette support on earlier versions and did some major changes on versions 5.1->5.3.
=============
 Changes
=============
[Version 5.6]
  - Add CAVE_AIR & BUBBLE_COLUMN to replaceable materials list.
[Version 5.5]
  - Remove Wither Roses from the canReplace list.
[Version 5.4]
  - Added support for HolographicDisplays
    - When present, and enabled in the config, Cenotaph will spawn a hologram on top of the cenotaph rather than a sign.
  - Added command: /cenadmin deletehologram
    - Removes orphaned holograms from cenotaphs
    - Must be in same chunk and within 5 blocks distance of the hologram
    - Requires cenotaph.admin.deletehologram permission node.
[Version 5.3]
  - New database schema. Old databases will auto-convert.
  - Removed lockette and LWC support and replaced it with built-in security system that requires no signs.
  - Moved various things over to a new CenotaphUtil.
  - Moved listeners to their own package.
  - Cleaned up startup sequence.
  - Fixed double chests spawning as two separate single chests. (Showed up as a bug in MC 1.13)
  - Made signs on top of double chests always face the 'foot' of the tomb, enhancing the realism of the blocky tomb-like sign/chest combination.
  - Fixed dynmap support.
  - Added protection from pistons/explosions/burning to built-in security.
  - Replaced TNT/Creeper Protection with generalized explosions protection.
  - Changed from bukkit to spigot for development.
  - Added actionbar messages for Denial of access to secured/protected chests, this will lessen some of the chat spam.
  - Created CenotaphMessaging to handle messages.
  - Added the ability for /cenadmin to be used by the console.
  - Added a CenotaphMessaging function that can smartly send to player or console (if the sender is not a player.)
  - Fix up the findPlace function for finding good spots for chests.
    - No longer will dying with a full inventory in a 1x1x1 hole cause only one chest to be used while the rest overflows onto the ground.
    - When double chests are required the oneBlockUpCheck is always tried for (if enabled.)
  - Remove noReplaceList which wasn't actually doing anything that the OneBlockUpCheck does better.
  - Update list of blocks that can be replaced in the canReplace(mat) function.
    - Covers crops via Ageable, use tags for small flowers and saplings.
  - Remove the noDestroy option from the config, which became redundant after the security became built-in.
    - Set your config's security to not time-out and you have the exact same effect.
[Version 5.2]
  - Completely replaced the config with dumptruckman's CommentedConfiguration system.
    - This means you don't have to regenerate your config.yml after updating Cenotaph.
    - System is used by Towny/TownyChat and many other plugins.
    - New config options in the future will add themselves with default settings.
  - Removed the deathmessages section of the config.yml
    - For now entity names are pulled from the server, meaning new entities are automatically handled.
    - Environmental deathcauses are hardcoded to English for the time being.
  - Removed version checker option from config, I don't think this worked.
  - Cleaned up some of the TODO's that were done.
[Version 5.1]
  - Update to much of the Lockette/Sign code to make it not use deprecated API.
  - Update to use UUIDs in TombBlocks, allowing us to use less deprecated methods.
  - Update to pom.xml's sk89q's repos, making them not be required in the lib folder.
  - Update to economy handler, no longer errors when Vault is not found on a server.
  - Old databases will have old tombstones which do not have ownerUUID
    values. These will be null, and means that for those tombstones there
    will be no message sent to a player when their security runs out/they
    have their tombstone destroyed, (but these messages wouldn't be shown
    anyways if this happened while they were offline.)
[Version 5.0]
  - Recompiled for 1.14.4
[Version 4.9]
  - Fixed block checks for 1.14. (SIGNS are different now behind the scenes as there are now signs for all wood types)
  - LWC - Moved LWC support to http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/LWC/.  It is actively being developed.
  - Update Vault to 1.7
  - Update WorldGuard support to use new WorldGuard API calls.
[Version 4.8]
  - Fixed block checks for 1.13.
  - LWC - Moved LWC support to Modern LWC. It has Block Name support, However during my testing, the current released plugin is broken for 1.13. 
       It is being actively developed. So I have left the support in for the eventuality that they will get it updated.
