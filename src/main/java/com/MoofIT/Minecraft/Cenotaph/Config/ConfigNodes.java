/**
 * Config consists of an Enum of values which are smartly added to existing configs
 * when there is an update that needs to be done. Default values are only over-
 * written when value is completely removed from an existing config.
 * 
 * To add config options follow these instructions.
 *  - Must have 2 or more values.
 *  - First value is where the option will be placed: section1.subsection2.subsubsection3
 *  - Second value is the default.
 *  - Third and onwards are lines of comments added to the block. 
 *  - To put a gap between config options make the first line of comments (the third value) 
 *    an "".
 *    
 *  Settings of the config are pulled from CenotaphSettings. 
 *  After adding a new config option, remember to add it to the CenotaphSettings.
